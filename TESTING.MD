I tested the complete functionality of the site. This includes:

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Validating Forms | Registration forms submitted with<br> a variety of correct and incorrect data | New members created and <br>taken to home page |
| Navbar Text<br>and icons | Test all Navbar links<br> to ensure correctness of links | All links working as expected |
| Message on login | Test login with different users | Message in the home screen always shows<br>the correct user and number of tasks  |
| Add a task | Add tasks using all options | Tasks always added with correct information<br>regardless of which selections are made in the form  |
| Edit a task | Edit tasks using all options | Tasks always edited with correct information<br>regardless of which selections are made in the form  |
| Delete a task | Test delete button in task list | Delete button works as expected |
| 404 and 500 pages | Test 404 and 500 pages | Not yet created |
| Stylesheet | Available sitewide | Working as expected |
| Registration | Register with different usernames<br>Try to enter the same username twice | Registration works without issue. Usernames must be unique |

## Python, CSS, JavaScript and HTML Tests

 <details>

<br>

***python***

 Reformatting was performed on the python files using the code formatter [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

<br>

***CSS and JavaScript Tests***

 [CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - css code validated

 ![css](my_tasks/readme/images/css-validator.png)<br><br>

 [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) was used to remodel format in Django

 ***HTML Testing***

 All html pages were tested using the [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/ ) Service.

 To ensure all code was validated accurately, the 'view page source' command in Google Chrome was used as follows:

- On each page of the deployed application right-click anywhere on the page and select View Page Source.
- Copy the entire code
- Go to the validator.w3.org service and select the "validate by direct input" tab
- Paste the code into the box provided and click the CHECK button

I also tested each individual link (examples below) with the only issue being the HTML generated by the Django form in the register page, which I could not fix.

## Restrospective

As the site is not too large scale, I think the amount of testing done has been sufficient. I did some usability testing with a family member and made some changes following this which was very helpful.

I hope to undertake a lot more automated testing in my next project and will place an emphasis on writing the test cases before writing functions.
